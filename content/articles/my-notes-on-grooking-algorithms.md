# Chapter 1 - Introduction

An algorith is a set of instructions for accomplishing a task. Every piece of code could be called an algorithm.

## Binary Search

Binary search is an algorithm that receives a sorted list as input (:warning: binary search won't work if the list is not sorted.) and a search subject. It returns the position in the list where the search subject is located.

```go
// This is go(ish) pseudo code.
list := []int{5,10,15,20, 25}

fmt.Println(binarySearch(list, 10))
// Output: 1
```

In general, for any list of size `n`, binary search will take `log n` steps to run in the worst case. In comparison, linear search will take `n` steps.

> :bulb: When speaking about time/space complexity the logarithm is always base 2

### Using it in go

There are the three custom binary search functions: [sort.SearchInts](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#SearchInts), [sort.SearchStrings](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#SearchStrings) or [sort.SearchFloat64s](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/#SearchFloat64s).

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sort"
)

func main() {
   list := []int{5,10,15,20, 25}

   fmt.Println(sort.SearchInts(list, 10))
}
```

### :bulb: Go 1.18 and generics

Starting from v1.18 generics support is available in Go, with this release also an experimental package arrived that offers a _"general"_ binary search implementation for slices.

In the long run this implementation should replace the 3 functions available in v1.17 and before.

- Slice pkg: https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/exp/slices#BinarySearch

Binary search is an extract from the original implementation :top:

```go
// BinarySearch searches for target in a sorted slice and returns the smallest
// index at which target is found. If the target is not found, the index at
// which it could be inserted into the slice is returned; therefore, if the
// intention is to find target itself a separate check for equality with the
// element at the returned index is required.
func BinarySearch[Elem constraints.Ordered](x []Elem, target Elem) int {
	return search(len(x), func(i int) bool { return x[i] >= target })
}

// where search is defined as
func search(n int, f func(int) bool) int {
	// Define f(-1) == false and f(n) == true.
	// Invariant: f(i-1) == false, f(j) == true.
	i, j := 0, n
	for i < j {
		h := int(uint(i+j) >> 1) // avoid overflow when computing h
		// i â‰¤ h < j
		if !f(h) {
			i = h + 1 // preserves f(i-1) == false
		} else {
			j = h // preserves f(j) == true
		}
	}
	// i == j, f(i-1) == false, and f(j) (= f(i)) == true  =>  answer is i.
	return i
}

---
// and then it can be used as follows
list := []int{5,10,15,20,25}
want := 10

if idx := BinarySearch(list, want); list[idx] == want {
    return idx
} else {
    return nil
}
```

## Running time

Generally you want to choose the most efficient algorithm whether you're optimizing for time or space.

## Big O

It's a special notation that tells you the rate in which the execution time or the necessary space grows.

> :bulb: Big O notation is about the worst case-scenario.

Common notations are:

- `O(1)` or constant
- `O(n)` or linear
- `O(n^2)` or quadratic
- `O(log n)` or logarithmic
- `O(2^n)` or exponential
- `O(n!)` or factorial
- `O(n log n)` or linearithmic

:pushpin: `n` == `len(list)`

Example: Operations performed for lists of size 1, 8, 64, and 1024.

| Big O      | len(1) | len(8) | len(64)           | len(1024)                                 |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| O(1)       | 1      | 1      | 1                 | 1                                         |
| O(n)       | 1      | 8      | 64                | 1024                                      |
| O(n^2)     | 1      | 64     | 4096              | 1048576                                   |
| O(log n)   | 1      | 3      | 6                 | 10                                        |
| O(2^n)     | 1      | 256    | 1.8446744 x 10^19 | 1.797693134862315907729305190789 x 10^308 |
| O(n!)      | 1      | 40320  | 1.2688693 X 10^89 | infinity (too big to compute)             |
| O(n log n) | 1      | 24     | 384               | 10240                                     |

# Chapter 2 - Selection sort

## How memory works

Each time you want to store something in memory, you need to ask the computer for some space, then you will get the address of the next available memory slot and you can store your information in there.

```go
// We are telling go to store 100 as a variable which will use memory space
variable := 100

// If we want to get the address in memory for our variable we need to do this
address := &variable

println(address, variable) // outputs something like 0xc00003c768 100
```

## Arrays and linked lists

### Linked lists

A linked list contains a reference to the location of the next item in the list, this way a bunch of memory addresses can be linked together.

Example:

```
a->b->c->d->null
```

This feature allow items to be stored anywhere in memory, you can always reach them using the address stored in the list.

### Arrays

An array is a continous list stored in memory where you know the location and value of all items.

Example:

```
[]int{0,1,2,3,4}
```

This forces an array to allocate continous space in memory leading to data relocation when more space is needed and no contigous space in memory is available.

### Arrays vs Linked lists

- Arrays are great if you want to read random or non-contigous elements.
- Linked lists are great if you are going to read all the items one at a time.

### Terminology

The elements in an array are numbered, most programming languages start with 0 and not 1. When you see a reference to an array element located at index 1 it is refering to the second element of the array and not the first one.

> :bulb: The position of an element in an array is called _index_.

These are the run times for common operations on arrays and linked lists:

|           | Arrays | Lists |
| --------- | ------ | ----- |
| Reading   | O(1)   | O(n)  |
| Insertion | O(n)   | O(1)  |

### Insertions

Whit lists it is easy to insert, you need to change the pointers to the next and current elements.

```go
type node struct {
	Value int
	Next *node
}

root := node{10, nil}

// Imagine we need to insert another node into our list
root.Next = &node{5, nil}

// Imagine we need to insert another node into our list
root.Next = &node{5, nil}

fmt.Printf("root is %v and next is %v\n", root, root.Next)
// Output: root is {10 0xc000108050} and next is &{5 <nil>}

// Lets imagine now they asks us to insert a new node with value 8 after the first node.

n := &node{8, nil}
n.Next = root.Next
root.Next = n
fmt.Printf("root is %v and next is %v, and next.Next is %v", root, root.Next, root.Next.Next)
// Output: root is {10 0xc000096260} and next is &{8 0xc000096230}, and next.Next is &{5 <nil>}
```

### Deletions

When it comes to deletions the situation doesn't change much, lists are better, you just need to move the pointer and :bomb: an item is off the list.

```go
// main()
type node struct {
	Val  int
	Next *node
}

root := &node{10, nil}

root.Next = &node{9, nil}

root.Next.Next = &node{8, nil}

n := root

for n != nil {
	fmt.Println(n.Val)
	n = n.Next
}

// Now let's suppose we only want even numbers in our list,
// so we need to remove the 9

root.Next = root.Next.Next

n = root

for n != nil {
	fmt.Println(n.Val)
	n = n.Next
}

```

Go playground: https://go.dev/play/p/HWwpT8tteu1

With arrays everything needs to be moved but unlike insertions deletions will always work.

> :bulb: array insertions can fail when there is no more space in memory and the array cannot be dynamically extended.

### :bookmark:

It is a common practice to keep track of the first and last element of a linked list, that way removing or inserting at the start / end of the list is always O(1).

There are two different types of access, _random access_ and _sequential access_.

**:pushpin: Linked lists can only do sequential access**

**:pushpin: Arrays are better if you need random access**

> :bulb: Random access means that you can inmmediatly jump to any point of the array.

```go
arr := []int{1,2,3,4,5}

// Random access to 4
arr[3] // prints 4

// With a list you will get sequential access:
// Image the list above is represented using linked nodes: 1->2->3->4->5->nil
root.Next.Next.Next // prints 4
```

Common run time for operations on arrays and linked lists.

|          | Arrays | Lists |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| Reading  | O(1)   | O(n)  |
| Writing  | O(n)   | 0(1)  |
| Deleting | O(n)   | O(1)  |

## Selection sort

Given a comparable value sort by picking the highest (desc) / lowest (asc) value and moving it to the righ position, this is know as in place sorting, do this until your list is sorted.

```go
// Sort the given array
arr := []int{20,234,2,23,90,4}

func selectionSort(list []int) []int {
	var n = len(list)
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		var minIdx = i
		for j := i; j < n; j++ {
			if list[j] < list[minIdx] {
				minIdx = j
			}
		}
		list[i], list[minIdx] = list[minIdx], list[i]

		// See how the array changes on every pass.
		fmt.Println(list)
	}

	return list
}

// main()
fmt.Println(selectionSort(arr))
```
